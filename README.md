The fractions of uncultured microbes are wildly different among environment
They have attracted lots of interest - in part because it is reasonable to imagine that they are physiologically different from cultured microbes. But we donâ€™t actually know that. This project applies a sequence similarity and machine learning approach to predict genomic features relating to the unculturedness of microbes.
